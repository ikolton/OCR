# Extraction Module

The Extraction Module is designed to process OCR-extracted text from invoices and retrieve key information such as dates and the total amount. By using regular expressions, the module identifies and extracts relevant data points, making it easier to integrate with invoice processing systems.

## Features

- **Date Extraction:**  
  Uses regex patterns to detect date formats (e.g., `12/03/2023`, `2023-03-12`).

- **Total Amount Extraction:**  
  Identifies and extracts the total invoice amount from the text, supporting common currency symbols such as `$` and `â‚¬`.

- **Logging:**  
  Utilizes Python's built-in `logging` library to log the extracted values, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

## Available Functions

- **Parameters:**  
  - `text` (str): The OCR-extracted text from an invoice.

    - **Due Date:** The due date for the invoice payment (if found, otherwise `"Not Found"`).
    - **Unknown Dates:** A list of any additional date occurrences found in the text.
