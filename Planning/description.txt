This project is an invoice scanning system designed to automate the detection and extraction of key information from invoice images. It leverages image processing techniques to enhance and standardize the input, detects and crops the invoice area, and uses OCR to convert the document into machine-readable text. The modular design allows for easy expansion to include advanced data extraction and classification, while initially providing a simple CLI-based interface for user interaction.
